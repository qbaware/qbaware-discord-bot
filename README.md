# Qbaware's Discord Bot

The bot supports two main features:
1. *Commands* via which people can interact with it.
2. Sending messages to Qbaware's Discord channel when there's a new release in multiple Qbaware repositories.

## Commands

Currently, it only supports the following commands:
- `ping` - Outputs the latency between the bot and Discord's servers.
- `help` - Lists all commands that the bot supports.
